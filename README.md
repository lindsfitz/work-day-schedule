# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

The date and time at the top automatically update throughout the day through the use of Moment.js.

Additionally, the timeblocks are color coordinated to indicate past, present, and future events. 

The user can exit out and reopen the browser window without losing their previously entered events, as they are dynamically stored in Local Storage as they are added. 

This application allows employees with busy schedules to manage time effectively as they can visualize all of their important events for the day. 



## Acceptance Criteria
